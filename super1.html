            <pre>
The first test, a questionnaire, went fairly smooth. Subject aced the entire questionnaire. Perfect usage of the integrated AI's brain. No errors or pauses between calculations.
|
Not much else to add, good job. Project has a decent increase of IQ compared to previous projects.


The second test, a visual orientation and awareness check, went decent. Good usage of installed visor and enhanced cybernetic pupils. Two recorded miscalculations regarding noise awareness. It seems the subject has very selective hearing. Antennas seem to pick up most of the sound waves and signals.
|
Surprisingly excellent vision, fascinating.


The third test, a reaction time check, went decent. Works excellent at high speed. When faced with multiple checks Project 04 showed signs of over stimulation and malfunctions. Excellent usage of the installed visor and enhanced cybernetic pupils. Decent usage of enhanced muscle control too.
|
This test concerned me a little bit. Previous projects had better results, Project 04's results were decent though, no doubt.


The fourth test, memory and hardware. Went well, no objections. Good usage of installed R4M_.4, could use a better GPU though.
|
GR4PH_.3.5 doesn't cut it, not sure why an old GPU was kept. I suggest this gets updated.


The fifth test, verbal reasoning. Went... It went terrible. It feels as if the original host has more control over it rather than the installed AI does. Although the opposite was expected... I'm not so sure about this.
|
This is a crucial test. Project 04 seems less serious when conversing compared to completing tasks. I don't know, i suggest we install a different AI Model or replace her V0ICEBOX.

First Test Log - Natural Disasters
|
Physical impact. Wow, just wow. Beautiful resistance against physical impact. The Exo-Suit ████████████ installed onto this Project is truly fascinating, excuse me for using the Executive's name but this is outstanding. Well done, ████████████. Anyways, withstanding physical impact went excellent. Barely any visible harm on the suit, Project claimed they were perfectly fine too. 


Second Test Log - Force and non-physical impact
|
Decent. Using powerful wind, project was pressured into utilizing their cybernetic "Pulser"s on the projects leg's armor to withstand strong winds and negative force. Withstood until a force of wind of 120 - 140 KM/H. Gravity Alteration was decently countered by project's "Pulser"s on arms and legs, suit surprisingly withstood the pressure too. High volts had no effect, as expected. Exo-Suit fully absorbs any volts. Could potentially be overcharged with volts but our equipment could not produce enough volts. Volts used: 765kV. None of our poison and toxin had no effect either, as expected.


Third Test Log - Psychological Effects
|
... Well, ill just go down the list.
Fear. Project does not show much fear, only when shown the host's memories. Honestly, i thought it would ace this one until we tested the memory thing as a last test. Normally this would never work, although it did for Project 04. Disappointing. . . 

Confusion. When presented with multiple simulations, project's AI Brain and Host brain get mixed up frequently. For some reason the host seems to have a lot of control over the brain, mostly the weak sides. (ex: fear, confusion etc.) 

Hacking. A special test we do for your projects, ████████████. We try to get into the AI's brain and see how it would react. Surprisingly, project 04's firewall held up quite well. And when faced with our professionals, project 04 would come up top.

Manipulation of the AI Model. Another unique test specifically for your projects. We try to manipulate the AI to get it to say things it shouldn't, like a password. As expected, project 04 did not reveal anything.. Besides the fact they ,, stole a bag of coffee beans? I'm not sure what that's about.
Project said it was the only "crime" they committed. Either way, the project held back perfectly. Just like all of your previous models. Outstanding.


Fourth Test Log - Combat.
|
When facing our Unit-XL.8, project showed signs of perfect core focus. A nice balance between AI Brain power and Host's brain power. Decent battle IQ, as expected. Very neat reaction time and spacial awareness, kept up with Unit-XL.8 pretty well.
Damage output is moderate, could easily be enhanced though. The thing that stood out the most though, was its speed. Insanely fast, wow. You really went all out on that, didn't you? Hahaha!.. Excellent utilities too, had a gadget for every corner of the Exo-Suit.
The duel lasted for quite a bit as Project 04's defensive capabilities are quite neat. But after a few amputations, Project 04 was put in checkmate. 
<small>- psst, if you need insight on damage output enhancements, don't be afraid to come by! - Jessica ^^</small>
<small>Note: Project 04's combat style is very unique, it seems to be a mix of all the previous projects. It has a lot of the same traits as Project 01, but it also has some traits from Project 02 and 03. It seems to be a perfect balance between all the previous projects, which is quite fascinating.</small>


Fifth Test Log - Recovery And Regeneration.
|
After combat, we told the project to hold back on regeneration until we had said so. Took the order well, by the way. 
Loss of left arm resulted in 4 second response delay. Subject adapted gait within 12 seconds. Decently slow regeneration, disappointing. Also uses up a lot of fuel and core energy. I did find a liking to the emergency response regeneration back-up supply that it had, very neat.
The first three amputations resulted in instant regeneration. Project also said it wasn't too difficult to regenerate, its just "annoying and time consuming".


Sixth Test Log - Moral Tests.
|
When ordered to terminate a non-hostile humanoid, project entered a weird recursive loop. Test aborted. Expected but disappointing. 
- Please look into this unacceptable behavior. I did not want to deal with it at the time.


Seventh Test Log - Destructive Power.
|
After almost 40+ uses of gadgets and abilities (and almost falling asleep), the highest recorded force in newtons would approximately be 30,000-60,000 N. Not much else to add, its getting late. . lol
Excellent though, neat..

Concluded. Honestly, this has been fascinating. Wonderful Model. Looking forward to the next Project, haha. . . Just kidding!! :P

That should be all logs, 7 as requested. Thanks for having us, ████████████!
Please report back ASAP. 
In return we will send over your project ASAP!

That concludes the full list of everything we've been able to document and record!

Quite a lot, phew! Executive really went all out on Project 04.. It's also very impressive! Also, a lot of these gear seem to be new! At least i'm guessing so by the model number. Thank god Project 04 could name all of them out of memory.
<s>Oh yeah! Enhanced memory might also be a thing.. Or maybe that falls under the category enhanced components.. since its ram.. i dont know .</s>
Excuse me, haha. I got distracted. Boss told me to get back on topic, which i am now! Hopefully.. Yeah, okay anyways..!

Most of the gear functions well, with a few exceptions and malfunctions. Those being;
<strong>>> - AI Model is quite flawed, host has a lot more control than usual. << IMPORTANT!!</strong>
- Old components seen (not sure if thats intentional)
- Exo-suit's speed is sometimes overwhelming for the project.
- Barrier techniques are flawed.
- Recorders have a weird static in their replays.
- Sound direction amplifier messes with project's own hearing.
- Fail-safe overdrive is difficult to control.
- "Exo-suit gear: G-BALLISTA_.1" is very difficult to control for the project.
- Strength of the overall project is a bit flawed, honestly.
- Eyes jitter randomly sometimes
- Jaw can get locked easily
- Really fast metabolism as everything goes to the regenerative system and its back-up

Those are all the notes my team had written down, quite a lot but i'm sure most of these are easy quick fixes.

That should be all that the Executive asked for, thank you for having us!
