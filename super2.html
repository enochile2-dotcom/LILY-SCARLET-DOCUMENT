████████████, "The Executive": This, right here - ..[ He pulled the huge red carpet off the project’s body, revealing what had once been a statue’s silhouette. ].. is REP's *UPCOMING BEST* project model, yet..! [ He'd bow as the project comes to life, slowly. ] . . .

Project 04: A-

[ Crowd cheering and clapping ]
-# [ The Executive also pats the project on its back, whispering something. After analyzing this video sequence, the following words have been made up out of the Executive's mouth movements; "Act civil." ]


████████████, "The Executive": That's right! I know you're all probably waiting for an actual, decent model. Well, i can assure you all that this model will definitely impress you all.. And most importantly, protect █████████, ███ █████ ██ █████████████! With the model having not twice, but THRICE as much gear as the last. As well as the most ENHANCED speed and perception BY FAR. We have also imported a lot of the old model's gear and capabilities and enhanced it even further. We really went all out for project 04, please respect our hard work. I shall now let the project speak for herself.

Project 04: Oh..! Oh yes.. yeah! I.. What? 

[ The project whispers to the Executive. Suspected to be: "Sorry, what do i say?" ]
[ The Executive can be seen annoyed. He then tilts his head. The project's eyes flash and suddenly..- ]

Project 04: It's a pleasure to finally be presented to the █████ of █████████████. I am extremely honored to be 04, for you all. The making of,,, well, me, has been an extremely difficult but a worthy project! The Executive's team and the collaborators have all been very hard at work, please congratulate them!

[ Crowd clapping ]
-# [ Executive is seen whispering again. "Lily, i need you to let the AI speak more than you do. This isn't a good image, please." ]

Project 04: I assume you all are very wavered by the horrendous events that had occurred recently on █████████████, which involved too many causalities which all could have been easily prevented. The old model just did not cut it. But worry not, please. I, 04, am very confident in my ability to aid and protect █████████. Please put your trust in us. Welcome me and the future of REP.

[ After a short silence, the crowd slowly build up to unconvincing clapping. ]

Project 04: You all should be grateful, seriously. The previous model was just simple pure bullsh██ scrap. Y'all don't even deserve protection, soul-less b██ches.

[ Silence. ]

[ The Executive can seen pressing a button, which doesn't seem to do much. He then calls over the guards to drag the model out of sight. ]

████████████, "The Executive": Excuse.. Excuse 04, please. Her AI model is-

[ Crowd boo-s loudly, video tape stops as the executive cuts the microphone and walks off stage. ]

Date: █/█/████: Project seems to care more about the safety of herself and other projects rather than humans, which was the programmed setting.

        <p><strong>Regarding; </strong> Project - 04, Lily Scarlet.</p>

            <pre>
As you may all already know, project 04's AI model is horrendously flawed. This includes her host having way more control over the AI even after tons of troubleshooting and fixing, her model suddenly losing control and many more issues that, when fixed, only cause more issues to appear.
Which is why after this letter has been sent out to the whole facility, Lily Scarlet will be sold to a different company. I'm sure many of us are devastated at the fact that we had to get rid of project 04, as it most obviously was our best work yet...
Disregarding the AI model. But worry not, we shall learn from our past mistakes and reflect to create Project 05X! A new, enhanced version of project 03! With everything we've learned from making 04, we can assure an excellent quality model.

Usually if a project fails, we'd scrap it and keep the parts to ensure evolving quality in all our projects. But with a model like this, scrapping them would not satisfy me.
Such amazing work and time gone so fast is never worth it, that is why we are lending it over to a company in need of it! The VSA.

Please consider this as a learning opportunity rather than a loss, we've all worked very hard and it is truly a sad sight to see an excellent model go but we must move on and learn.
